How To Use This Guide
When a rule or ability has a + behind it, the rule or ability that follows is an addendum that alters the original rule or ability.

When a rule or ability has a - behind it, the rule or ability that follows supersedes that of the original rule or ability fully or partially.

When a rule describing an ability has an ✷ before or after it this indicates a Karama card may be used to cancel this ability as detailed in Karama card description 3.01.11.01 and 3.01.11.02. The faction whose ability is cancelled may recalculate and retake that same action (ex: revival, shipment, movement) without the ability.

VARIANTS: Determine what variants will be used, if any.
SPICE BANK: Place all spice tokens in the Spice Bank.

Each player will sit to the right of the player with a lower number, excluding the highest number drawn (the player who drew number 1 will sit to their right). Prediction cards are returned to the Prediction deck.
FACTION SELECTION: Players now choose factions. In tournament play, each player is dealt two alliance cards (one of a Classic faction and one of an Expansion Faction), each player selects one secretly and returns the other to the box.

SECTORS: Sectors have no effect on movement. Forces can Move into or through a Territory ignoring all Sectors. A Sector's only function is to regulate the movement and coverage of the storm and spice collection.
STORM: As defined above in the Storm Phase section, no Force may Move into, out of, or through a Sector in storm.
Many territories occupy several Sectors, so that a player may Move into and out of a Territory that is partly in the storm, so long as the group does not pass through the part covered by the storm.

Battle Determination: Wherever two or more players' Forces occupy the same Territory, battles must occur between those players. Battles continue until just one player's Forces, or no Forces remain in all territories on the Board. -1.07.01.00 -1.07.01.02 -2.02.12
Players can not battle one another in a Territory if their Forces are separated by a Sector in storm. Their Forces can remain in the same Territory at the end of the Phase.
BATTLING BLIND: Whenever two or more players’ Forces are in the same Territory and in the same Sector under storm players still battle.
NEUTRAL ZONE: Players can not battle in the Polar Sink. It is a safe haven for everyone.
FIRST PLAYER: When resolving battles, the First Player is named the Aggressor until all their battles, if any, have been fought.

MULTIPLE BATTLES: When there are three or more players in the same Territory, the Aggressor picks who they will battle first, second, etc. for as long as they have Forces in that Territory.
Battle Plan: To resolve a battle, each player secretly formulates a Battle Plan. -1.14.01 -2.01.08 -2.01.09
A Battle Plan always includes the number of Forces dialed on the Battle Wheel. When possible, it must include a player's leader or a Cheap Hero. It may include Treachery Cards at the player's discretion.
BATTLE WHEEL: Each player picks up a Battle Wheel and secretly dials a number from zero to the number of Forces they have in the disputed Territory. Both players will lose the number of Forces dialed on their Battle Wheel.
LEADERS: One Leader Disc is selected and put face up in the slot on the wheel. A Cheap Hero Card may be played in lieu of a Leader Disc.
DEDICATED LEADER: Leaders that survive battles may fight more than once in a single Territory if needed, but no leader may fight in more than one Territory during the same Phase. -1.07.06.06.00
LEADER ANNOUNCEMENT: A player must always play either a leader or a Cheap Hero card as part of their Battle Plan if possible. When it is not possible, a player must announce that they can not play a leader or Cheap Hero.
NO TREACHERY: A player with no leader or Cheap Hero must still battle, but they can not play any Treachery Cards as part of their Battle Plan. (This situation can occur when a player does not have a Cheap Hero and all their leaders are in the Tleilaxu Tanks or have fought in another Territory in that Phase.)
TREACHERY CARDS: Players with a leader or Cheap Hero may play a Weapon Treachery Card, Defense Treachery Card, or both by holding them against the wheel. They may choose not to play Treachery Cards as well. +2.02.06 +2.02.07
REVEALING WHEELS: When both players are ready, the Battle Plans are Revealed simultaneously.
BATTLE RESOLUTION: The winner is the player with the higher total of number dialed on the Battle Wheel, plus their leader's fighting strength if applicable. -1.14.11
NO TIES: In the case of a tie, the Aggressor wins the battle.
WEAPONS: Check to see if your opponent protected their leader from your weapon with the proper Defense, if they did not, do not add their leader's fighting strength to their number dialed. Next, see if your weapon affects your leader, if it does check to see if you played the proper Defense, if not do not add your leader's fighting strength to your number dialed.
Note: Some weapons may not kill leaders but still make the leader's fighting strength nonapplicable.
KILLED LEADERS: Any leaders killed are immediately Placed face up in the Tleilaxu TanksThe winner immediately receives their value (including their own leader, if killed) in spice from the Spice Bank. -1.05.04 -3.02.02
SURVIVING LEADERS: Leaders who survive remain in the Territory where they were used. (Game effects do not kill these leaders while there.) These are not part of the Leader Pool until Leader Return [1.07.07]. -2.05.10 -4.03.08
LOSING: The losing player loses all the Forces they had in the Territory to the Tleilaxu Tanks and must discard every Treachery Card they used in their Battle Plan. Note that the loser does not lose their leader as a result of losing the battle.
WINNING: The winning player loses only the number of Forces they dialed on the Battle Wheel. These Forces are Placed in the Tleilaxu Tanks. The winning player may discard any of the cards they played; that player may keep any cards that do not say "Discard after use". -1.14.12
TRAITORS: When you are in a battle and your opponent uses a leader that matches a Traitor Card in your hand, you may call out "Traitor!" and pause the game. This can be done against any Active Leader your opponent has, even when that leader was not one of their Active Leaders at the start of the game.-2.01.12 +2.05.09 +4.09.01
When a Traitor Card is Revealed the Player who revealed the Traitor Card: immediately wins the battle, loses nothing, regardless of what was played in the Battle Plans (even if a lasgun and shield are Revealed), adds their leader back to their leader pool to be available again this Phase, Places the traitorous leader in the Tleilaxu Tanks, and receives the traitorous leader's fighting strength in spice from the Spice Bank. One time use abilities may be considered not used for this instance (Ex: Kwisatz Haderach, Captured leaders). One time use cards may be kept or discarded by the winner.
The Player Whose Traitor Was Revealed: loses all their Forces in the Territory and discards all of the cards they played.
TWO TRAITORS: When both leaders are traitors (each a traitor for the opponent), both players' Forces in the Territory, their cards played, and their leaders, are lost. Neither player receives any spice.
LEADER RETURN: After all battles have been fought, players collect any of their leaders used in battle still in Territories adding them to their Leader Pool.
Spice Collection Phase
This is the eighth Phase of the Turn. Forces in territories that contain spice may collect the spice. +1.13.01

COLLECTION RATE: The collection rate of spice for each Force is 2 spice per Force. If the player occupies Carthag and/or Arrakeen their collection rate is now 3 spice per Force.
UNCLAIMED SPICE: Uncollected spice remains where it is for future turns.
Mentat Pause Phase
This is the ninth Phase of the Turn. A winner (or winners) is declared, or players take some time to evaluate their positions on the map, then move the Turn Counter to the next position on the Turn Track to begin the next Turn.
COLLECT BRIBE SPICE: Add any spice from in front of your shield to your spice reserves.
Stronghold Victory
Players now check to see if the following requirements are met to achieve Stronghold Victory for one or more players.
Unallied Stronghold Victory: The requirement for an Unallied player to win is to Control three or more Strongholds with at least one of their Forces during the Mentat Pause Phase.
Allied Stronghold Victory: The requirement for an Alliance to win is to Control, between the Allied players, a total of four or more Strongholds with at least one or more Forces during the Mentat Pause Phase.
For example: if the Atreides are in an Alliance with the Fremen, and the Fremen Control Sietch Tabr, Carthag, and the Atreides Control Tuek's Sietch and Arrakeen during the Mentat Pause Phase, they win the game together.

MULTIPLE WINNERS: A player or alliance that has met the Stronghold requirement wins the game. When multiple player(s) and/or alliance(s) meet the requirements (as defined in 1.09.02) for a stronghold victory only the player or alliance first in Storm Order wins the game. -2.02.03
WAR CONTINUES: When there are no winners, players mull over their positions on the board, consider their options and, when they are ready, move the turn marker to the next position on the Turn Track to begin the next Turn.
END GAME OR DEFAULT VICTORY: The game is over when the desired number of Turns are reached. On the last Turn if no one has won and the Spacing Guild is not in the game the Fremen win. When the Fremen are not in the game either, the player Occupying the most Strongholds wins. If several qualify, all who qualify win. +2.06.08 +2.06.11
Alliances
Once a Shai-Hulud (sandworm) card is turned over on the second or subsequent turns, at the end of the Spice Blow and Nexus Phase, a Nexus occurs. During a Nexus, all players have a chance to make, join or break Alliances. Once players have had a chance to do so, play continues.
NEXUS

Alliance Limits: No more than two players may be in an Alliance with each other.
Landsraad Limits: Several Alliances can be formed during a Nexus, but no player can be a member of more than one Alliance.
Breaking an Alliance: Any player may break an Alliance during a Nexus. A player announces that they are breaking from their Alliance, they are now unallied.
Conclusion of A Nexus: Once all players have had a chance to ally, no further Alliances can be made until the next Nexus.
How an Alliance Functions
Allied players' Forces are considered the same for the purposes of victory.
The win condition is now 4 strongholds instead of 3 for players in an Alliance. If together their joint Forces Control 4 or more strongholds in the Mentat Pause Phase, they have jointly won the game. -2.11.15
Ally Secrecy: Allies may discuss and share strategy and information secretly at any time.
Separate Spice Holding: Allies may not give spice to one another. -2.03.06
Bidding: During the Bidding Phase, allies may help each other by paying some or all the cost of each other's Treachery Cards so that a player can bid more spice than they actually have.
Movement: During the Shipment and Movement Phase, allies may pay for each other's shipments.
Constraint: At the end of your Shipment and Movement actions, Place all your Forces that are in the same Territory (except the Polar Sink) as your Ally's Forces in the Tleilaxu Tanks. -2.02.12
Shared Advantages: Allies may assist one another with any abilities labeled: ALLIANCE.
Secrecy
Players are never required to keep their cards, spice holdings, or the traitors they selected secret. They are not obligated to Reveal this information either. -2.11.10.01 -2.11.10.05 -3.01.22 +3.02.01
SPICE RESERVES: All spice holdings should be kept behind the Player Shield.
HIDDEN HAND: The amount of Treachery Cards that any player has must be made known to any player that asks during the Bidding Phase but can be kept secret during any other Phase of the Turn.
Deals and Bribes

Players who are not members of the same Alliance can make any kind of verbal Bribe between one another. Once made, the conditions of these Bribes must be stated aloud and must be honored.A player cannot renege on a Deal or Bribe.
BRIBE SPICE: When Spice is paid as part of a Deal it is considered a Bribe. Allies can make deals with one another so long as it is not a Bribe.

These are the only limitations.
NO BRIBES DURING GAME SET UP: A Deal or Bribe can not be made until after 0.16.
TIME TO COLLECT: A Bribe can not be made after Mentat Pause Phase [1.09] of any Turn.
Advanced Game
For experienced players the game is changed by adding these rules: increasing the number of Spice Blows, adding a spice advantage for holding a city or Tuek's Sietch, (the smuggler stronghold), an enhanced Karama Card, an advanced battle system, and additional faction abilities (as stated in 2.xx.00). Decide as a group if you are playing Advanced in Set Up before any other step (0.00).
Increased Spice Flow: During Collection Phase [1.08], each occupant of Carthag and Arrakeen collects 2 spice and the occupant of Tuek's Sietch collects 1 spice. To qualify for collection, a player needs to occupy the stronghold only at the time of collection. If a player occupies two or three of these strongholds, they collect spice for each that they occupy.
DOUBLE SPICE BLOW: After 1.02.01 another Spice Card will be Revealed creating a second Spice Card discard pile (discard pile A and discard pile B).
When using double spice blow:
When a Shai-Hulud appears in the first discard pile (Pile A) any spice and Forces on a Territory Card at the top of discard pile A (if any) are lost to the Spice Bank and Tleilaxu Tanks respectively. The Shai-Hulud card is Put on the spice discard pile. Then another card is turned over. If it is a Shai-Hulud it is immediately discarded on pile A and another card is turned over. This continues until a Territory Card appears and spice is placed as defined in 1.02.04. The Territory Card is put face up on spice discard pile A. Then a Nexus occurs.
Now Reveal another spice card and repeat the above procedure using discard pile B.
SPICE DECK RESUFFLE: When the Spice Deck needs to be reshuffled, Shuffle in all discarded territory and Shai-Hulud cards under the top most territory card in Spice Discard Pile A and all Territory and Shai-Hulud cards in Spice Discard Pile B into the deck.

PAYMENT: All spice paid for Spice Dialing is Placed in the Spice Bank.

The Head Judge will do a head count and distribute players into tables of five or six players, making the most amount of six player games possible.
Once all players have been assigned a table they will fill out the Game Report provided.
After a brief introduction and establishment of expectations the timer will officially start and players will begin set up of game as described in 0.00
At the start of every Battle Phase [1.07] a judge will be called over to record win attempts made by players for the purpose of first tie breakers.
During the game if a player has made an illegal action and the players can not resolve the issue amongst themselves the Head Judge may be called over to settle the dispute. The judge's decision is final.
Rules questions can be asked of any judge including the Head Judge at any time, even away from the table.
At the end of every game a judge will be called over to fill out the rest of the Game Report.
The timer for any game is one hour for every player in the game. At the end of the time limit players will be given thirty minutes to finish the Turn they are on and fill out the Game Report with the judge.
ADJUDICATION: In games that have reached the time limit and there is no winner there will be an adjudication. An adjudicated victory is granted to the player with the most win attempts, if that player is allied their ally also receives an adjudicated victory. If players are tied for the most win attempts the tied players then compare the next category of tie breakers eliminating any players with a lower amount in that category until one player has the highest tie breaker uncontested. Allies combine their tiebreaker amounts in each category other than win attempts.
To gain entry into the finals the top players with the most weighted points proceed. Points are weighted therefore the players with heavier weighted points proceed over other players with the same amount of points with wins lower on the points allocation list.
For example, a player with 4 points due to a Solo Stronghold Victory & an Allied Default Victory will gain entry over a player with 4 points due to two Allied Stronghold Victories, because a Solo Stronghold Victory is the heaviest weighted points followed by a Bene Gesserit Prediction and so on.

The points allocation is as follows:
Solo Stronghold Victory=3pts
Bene Gesserit Prediction=3pts
Allied Stronghold Victory=2pts
Solo Fremen Challenged Special=2pts
Allied Fremen Challenged Special=1pts
End Game Victory=1pts
Solo Default Victory=1pts
Allied Default Victory=1pts
Adjudicated=0.5pts
In the case of a tie, entry into the finals will be granted to the player with the highest number in the first category of tiebreakers from their best played game this tournament. Any further Ties amongst only the tied players in a category will check the next set of tiebreakers until the amount of players left are equal to the amount of seats needed to be filled for the finals.
Example: Player A's best game is an allied Stronghold Victory with two win attempts, three Strongholds, eight forces on board, twelve spice, three Treachery Cards, and three leaders. The score for that game would be: 2.2.3.8.12.3.3.
Player B's best game is an allied Stronghold Victory with four win attempts, two Strongholds, two forces on board, four spice, two Treachery Cards, and one leader. The score for that game would be: 2.4.2.2.4.2.1. Player B would proceed to the finals over Player A.

The category of tiebreakers are as follows:
Win attempts made throughout the game.
Strongholds Controlled at the end of a game.
Forces on the Board at the end of the game.
Spice behind Player Shield at the end of the game.
Treachery cards in hand at the end of the game.
Active Leaders in Leader Pool at the end of the game.
Shield Wall Stronghold - as detailed in 4.02 the Shield Wall will be worth a stronghold point after the fourth worm.
With more than five possible Stronghold points it is possible for two players/alliance to have enough stronghold points to win, the win will be awarded to the player or alliance first in Storm Order.
Advisors will not automatically flip after the shipment and movement Phase.
There is now Storm Order in the Revival Phase [1.05].
You are not required to play a Cheap Hero [3.01.04] in a battle when you have no Active Leaders. You still must announce that you are playing no leader when you have no Active Leaders and are not playing a Cheap Hero.
Your Forces go to the tanks at the end of your shipment and movement action when ending in a Territory with allied Forces (other than Advisors and Forces in the Polar Sink).
Limited Truthtrance: Truthtrance will be limited to questions on the present or past. It cannot bind a player to a future action.
(E.g., When in a battle with a player you may ask, "Are you playing a Weapon in this battle?" or "Are you playing a Poison Weapon in this battle?")
Examples of questions that are NOT legal: "In our first battle this turn will you use a Poison Weapon?" or "If I move into Carthag will you move out?" "On Turn ten will you attack me?"
Fremen's allies do not count against the second criteria of Fremen's special victory condition ([2.04.09.02] Neither Harkonnen, Atreides, nor Emperor Forces occupy Tuek's Sietch.)
Shield Wall Stronghold
After the fourth worm (counting all worms, even Karama worms summoned by the Fremen) the Shield Wall counts as a Stronghold point for purposes of victory ONLY in the Mentat Pause Phase.
Only the left side (the side touching the Imperial Basin) will be considered a stronghold point in the Mentat Pause Phase [1.09]. Controlling the right side will not count for victory, nor will occupying the right side while either sector is under storm take away someone's stronghold point.
Shipment to the Shield Wall still costs 2 spice/token (1 spice/token for Guild Rates), as usual for rock Territories.
Occupation of the Shield Wall is not restricted to only 2 factions, as usual for rock Territories.
Forces are not destroyed on the Shield Wall by storm or worm, as usual for rock Territories.
Family Atomics may be used as written. When Family Atomics [3.01.07] is played, all Force tokens on the Shield Wall are destroyed (regardless of storm location), but the Shield Wall continues to be treated as a Stronghold point in the Mentat Pause Phase and continues to be unaffected by storm or worm.
If two separate factions Occupy the Shield Wall at the end of a Turn (due to location of the storm preventing battle between them), the faction on the left side is considered to control that Stronghold for the purposes of victory determination.
Leader Skill Cards
Leader Skill Cards provide each faction with a unique advantage. When assigned to a leader disc, that leader becomes a Skilled Leader.
When using Leader Skill Cards the Setup of the game is altered. After Player Positions [0.07], skip to and complete Starting Treachery Card [0.14], then Deal out two Leader Skill Cards to each faction. Each player chooses one to keep, and shuffles the other back into the Leader Skill Deck.
Put the card you keep face up in front of your faction shield, then choose one of your Leader Discs to Put face up next to your Leader Skill. This leader has that skill for as long as they are alive. Afterward, complete setup, from Traitors [0.11] continuing normally.
Skills are applied in the current battle unless your skilled leader is killed in that battle.
During Battle Plan [1.07.04] you may either leave the Skilled Leader face up in front of your faction shield or take it and the Leader Skill Card behind your shield.
During Leaders [1.07.04.02] when you use a Skilled Leader, put it in your wheel with the Leader Skill Card (along with any Treachery Cards normally). In this case, the top part of the skill is still in effect (if applicable). You can also use the bottom part of the skill associated with that leader in Revealing Wheels [1.07.05].
During Leaders [1.07.04.02] when you use a non-skilled leader in battle, and the Skilled Leader is behind the shield, no part of the skill is available to you.
During Leaders [1.07.04.02] when you use a non-skilled leader in battle, and the Skilled Leader is in front of your shield, the top part of the skill can still be used (if applicable).
After the battle, Put the Skilled Leader (if still alive) and the Leader Skill Card in front of your shield. This leader is no longer in your leader pool until Leader Return [1.07.07].
Any skill that mentions a card type (e.g., Poison Weapon) requires that the card included in the Battle Plan is played as that card type to gain the skill bonus.
Therefore, a card like Chemistry (from the Ixians and Tleilaxu expansion) would have to be played as a poison weapon when using the Master of Assassins skill to gain its bonus.

When your leader associated with the skill is killed, shuffle the Leader Skill Card back into the Leader Skill Deck. -4.03.14.02.01 -4.03.14.05.01
Whenever you revive any leader of your faction, if you have no Leader Skill Card, you may draw two Leader Skill Cards, and then choose one to play face up in front of your shield and assign the newly revived leader to that skill.The unused card is shuffled back into the Leader Skill Card deck.
When a Skilled Leader is captured, the skill goes with them. Harkonnen may only use the bottom ability of captured leaders.
Each Leader Skill Card has two abilities:
Each card has a top and bottom ability which is separated by the card artwork.
Top: The ability above the card artwork. This is a passive ability that is used when applicable.
Bottom: The ability below the card artwork. Prefaced by “This leader in battle:” This ability can only be used during Revealing Wheels [1.07.05] when the Skilled Leader is the selected Leader in a battle.
