Please investigate what you implemented so far. Check out the rest of the codebase and see if you can make it more maintainable. 

It is generally better if you clean up, make some folders and some files to split things into multiple components if it makes sense. 

It is essential that you always have one single source of truth, because if you don't there will inevitably be painful bugs. 

Ensure the code you write is DRY! Don't repeat yourself.
