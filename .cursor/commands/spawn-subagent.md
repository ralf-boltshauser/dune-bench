You can spawn a new agent by opening a url with a prompt in this format: 
https://cursor.com/link/prompt?text=Research+and+find+one+bug+in+this+codebase

Also ensure you tell them clearly how to document their findings / actions, in .notes/agent-communication/... so that you can review later! 

You need to give them full context in the prompt, since they start from scratch. You can also give them instructions in a file and then tell them to read it. 

Ensure that all files you create for communications between agents are in the .agents-communication directory. 

Always open the urls in the browser, so the user can directly start agents.
