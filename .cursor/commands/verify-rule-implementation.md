Verify that the rule implementation works correctly.

- Run any existing tests that might cover this functionality
- Check if the implementation handles edge cases mentioned in the rule
- Verify it integrates properly with the game flow
- Test with different game states if possible

If there are no tests yet, at least verify the code compiles and the logic looks correct based on the rule definition.

Don't write new tests yet - that can be done separately. Just verify what we have works.
