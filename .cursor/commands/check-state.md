Please check in on the subagents you created. Some of them are possibly already finished or in progress. 

Please summarize the state where they stand and if things are on track. 

If everything is finished report this to me. 

If sub agents are finished but the goal is not reached: 
- define the goal again
- analyse the status quo
- define what is the gap
- group tasks into independent chunks that can be assigned to new subagents
