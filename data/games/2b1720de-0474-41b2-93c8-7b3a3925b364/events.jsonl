They start strong but have limited forces. With only 4 turns, they'd need to capture 2 more strongholds to win.\n\n2. **Fremen**: Strong faction with desert knowledge and high forces.

In a short game, they're well-positioned to defend their stronghold and potentially capture others.\n\n3. **Me (BG)**: I'm in a weaker position initially, but my prediction ability gives me a unique advantage.\n\n**Prediction Decision:**\nWith only 4 turns and the Spacing Guild already controlling one stronghold but being outnumbered, the **Fremen** are the most likely to win. They'll likely consolidate their stronghold and can defend effectively.
