The two unoccupied strongholds are Sietch Tabr and Habbanya Sietch\n3. **Atreides Threat**: Atreides will likely ship/move forces to expand control. If I wait, they move first and may secure a strategic position\n4. **Half-Price Advantage**: My shipping is half-cost, so I should act to gain board presence before competition intensifies\n5. **Early Game Position**: With limited spice (5), I need to be efficient. Acting now lets me use my intrusion ability or make strategic early moves\n\n**Decision: ACT NOW**\n\nActing before Atreides allows me to:\n- Potentially use intrusion to claim an unoccupied stronghold\n- Secure better positioning before they expand\n- Maintain initiative in early game","data":{"reason":"Act before Atreides to secure strategic positioning and potentially use intrusion ability to claim an unoccupied stronghold early in the game","faction":"spacing_guild","actNow":true}},"seq":50}
