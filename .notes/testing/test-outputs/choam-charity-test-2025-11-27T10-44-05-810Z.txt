**Reasoning:**
- With a [0m

[LOG] [2m       quickly
- Atreides starts with control of Arrakeen (a stronghold)
- Given [0m
[LOG] [2m       the extremely limited turn count, Atreides' starting position gives them [0m
[LOG] [2m       the best chance to rapidly secure additional strongholds or achieve [0m

1. **High Value**: Strength 5 makes him [0m

[LOG] [2m       **Action Taken: Dialed 8 for initial storm placement**

**Reasoning:**
- [0m
[LOG] [2m       I dialed 8, which will be combined with Atreides' and Harkonnen's dials [0m
[LOG] [2m       to determine the final storm sector
- With minimal forces on the board [0m
[LOG] [2m       (just 1 at Polar Sink), I'm not overly concerned about storm damage to [0m
[LOG] [2m       myself
- A moderate dial helps position the storm while keeping my [0m
[LOG] [2m       options flexible
- As Bene Gesserit, my early game strategy focuses on [0m
[LOG] [2m       gathering information and positioning advisors rather than direct [0m
[LOG] [2m       military confrontation
- The actual storm position will depend on what [0m
[LOG] [2m       the other factions dialed, but this gives me a balanced starting position [0m

[LOG] [2m       **Decision Made: Dialed 13**

**Reasoning:**
- This is a moderate-to-high [0m
[LOG] [2m       dial that will position the storm in a strategically advantageous [0m
[LOG] [2m       location
- My Carthag stronghold (sector 11) is protected from storm [0m
[LOG] [2m       damage regardless of placement
- A dial of 13 will help establish the [0m
[LOG] [2m       storm in a position that can threaten opponents' sand territories while I [0m
[LOG] [2m       consolidate my position
- This balanced approach gives me flexibility in [0m
[LOG] [2m       the early game without overcommitting to an extreme strategy

The final [0m
[LOG] [2m       storm position will depend on what Atreides (who dials second in the [0m
[LOG] [2m       storm order) dials, but I've positioned myself well for Turn 1. [0m
