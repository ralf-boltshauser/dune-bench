[LOG] [37m    💭 Reasoning:[0m
[LOG] [2m       **Prediction Made: Atreides will win on Turn 1**

**Reasoning:**
- The [0m
[LOG] [2m       Atreides start with control of Arrakeen, giving them a strong [0m
[LOG] [2m       foundation
- They are historically the most powerful faction and tend to [0m
[LOG] [2m       move aggressively early
- For a Turn 1 victory to occur, it would likely [0m
[LOG] [2m       be the faction already positioned with strongholds and resources
- If my [0m
[LOG] [2m       prediction is correct, I win the game instead of the Atreides!

My [0m
[LOG] [2m       strategy as Bene Gesserit will now be to subtly manipulate events to make [0m
[LOG] [2m       this prediction come true - either by supporting Atreides moves or by [0m
[LOG] [2m       preventing other factions from blocking their path to victory. The [0m
[LOG] [2m       prediction victory is my primary win condition. [0m

**Reasoning:** I've secured [0m
[LOG] [2m       the weapon card at minimum cost (2 spice), leaving me with 4 spice for [0m
[LOG] [2m       future actions. Chaumurky is a useful combat card, and the low bid price [0m
[LOG] [2m       makes this an efficient acquisition. The Emperor's initial low bid [0m
[LOG] [2m       suggests they may not have wanted this card strongly, so I expect this [0m
