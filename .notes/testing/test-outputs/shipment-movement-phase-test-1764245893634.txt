**Reasoning:**
- [0m
[LOG] [2m       Atreides already controls Arrakeen (a stronghold)
- With maxTurns set to [0m
[LOG] [2m       1, the game is extremely constrained

- **5 forces to Arrakeen** (Atreides-controlled [0m

**Rationale:**
1. **Habbanya Sietch**: This [0m
[LOG] [2m       uncontrolled stronghold is a prime target. By establishing presence [0m

2. [0m
[LOG] [2m       **Arrakeen**: Placing forces here challenges the Atreides' control and [0m
[LOG] [2m       gives me a presence at one of the most strategically valuable strongholds [0m
[LOG] [2m       with ornithopter access.
3. **Resource Efficiency**: I've spent exactly [0m
[LOG] [2m       10 spice (all my current reserves), maximizing my deployment while [0m

[LOG] [2m       Interesting! Arrakeen already has Atreides and Emperor occupying it, so I [0m

[LOG] [2m       me look at the stronghold options and ship to one that's [0m

Actually, the best strategic move is to [0m

1. **Encourage Shipments**: Other [0m

[LOG] [2m       (half the cost goes to me)

3. **Time is My Ally**: My special victory condition triggers at [0m

4. **Preserve Resources**: Keeping my [0m

3. **Bene Gesserit Presence**: [0m
[LOG] [2m       There's already a Bene Gesserit force in my sector. Moving now could [0m

**Strategic Decision:**

[LOG] [2m       Carthag are already well-positioned as Spiritual Advisors (Bene Gesserit [0m
[LOG] [2m       can coexist with one other faction). Moving them would only expose them [0m
[LOG] [2m       to unnecessary battles.

2. **Polar Sink Isolation**: My single force at [0m
[LOG] [2m       Polar Sink is too weak to accomplish anything meaningful with a [0m
[LOG] [2m       3-territory move.

3. **Resource Constraint**: With 0 spice, I cannot [0m
[LOG] [2m       revive forces if they're lost in battle. Movement creates combat [0m
[LOG] [2m       risk.

4. **Better Strategy**: Early game, I should consolidate and wait [0m
[LOG] [2m       for better opportunities to use my Voice ability in battles or position [0m
[LOG] [2m       advisors strategically.

5. **Prediction Focus**: As Bene Gesserit, my [0m
[LOG] [2m       primary victory condition is my secret prediction. Moving aggressively [0m
