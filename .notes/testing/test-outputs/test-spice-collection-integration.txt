# Spice Collection Phase Integration Test Results

## Test Date
2025-11-27

## Test Scenario
Verify that spice collection phase works correctly in a full game context:
1. Setup game state with multiple factions
2. Place forces in territories with spice
3. Run spice collection phase
4. Verify automatic collection

## Test Results

### Basic Functionality
✓ Spice collection is automatic (no agent requests)
✓ Base rate: 2 spice per force works correctly
✓ City bonus: 3 spice per force when occupying Arrakeen or Carthag
✓ Collection limited by available spice
✓ Per-sector collection works correctly
✓ Phase completes immediately

### Edge Cases
✓ Limited spice scenario (10 forces, only 5 spice available) - collects 5
✓ Multiple sectors in same territory - collects from each sector separately
✓ No spice to collect - skips silently (no error)
✓ Forces in city without spice - gets city bonus for other territories

### Rules Compliance
✓ Rule 1.08 - HARVESTING SPICE: Forces occupying sectors with spice collect automatically
✓ Rule 1.08 - COLLECTION RATE: 2 spice/force base, 3 spice/force with city
✓ No optional decision - collection is mandatory when spice is present

## Conclusion
All tests pass. The spice collection phase now correctly implements the rules with automatic, mandatory collection at the appropriate rate.
