[LOG] [2m       Perfect! I have:
- 10 forces in Carthag (Sector 11)
- 10 spice in [0m
[LOG] [2m       reserves
- All my leaders available
- Carthag is in Sector 11

For the [0m
[LOG] [2m       initial storm placement, I want to consider:
- The storm will destroy [0m
[LOG] [2m       forces in sand territories and spice in its path
- I want to avoid [0m
[LOG] [2m       placing the storm near Carthag (Sector 11)
- I should dial a number that [0m
[LOG] [2m       either protects my position or damages opponents

Since the storm moves [0m
[LOG] [2m       counterclockwise from Sector 0, and considering typical Dune board [0m
[LOG] [2m       layouts, dialing a moderate number will help spread the storm away from [0m
[LOG] [2m       critical strongholds initially. 

I'll dial **12**. This will create a [0m
[LOG] [2m       reasonable total with my opponent's dial, moving the storm to a position [0m
[LOG] [2m       that likely affects sand territories but keeps it away from Carthag in [0m

[LOG] [37m    💭 Reasoning:[0m
[LOG] [2m       **Decision Made: Dialed 10**

**Reasoning:**
- A moderate dial value (10) [0m
[LOG] [2m       gives me flexibility in storm placement outcomes
- This is a neutral [0m
[LOG] [2m       choice that doesn't reveal my strategic intentions early
- By dialing in [0m
[LOG] [2m       the middle range, I avoid extreme positions that might draw attention
- [0m
[LOG] [2m       As the Bene Gesserit, I prefer to remain subtle and let others make [0m
[LOG] [2m       aggressive moves
- The final storm position will depend on what the first [0m
[LOG] [2m       opponent dials, but 10 provides good balance

Now the Atreides (first in [0m
[LOG] [2m       storm order) will dial, and their number combined with my 10 will [0m
[LOG] [2m       determine the initial storm sector. [0m
