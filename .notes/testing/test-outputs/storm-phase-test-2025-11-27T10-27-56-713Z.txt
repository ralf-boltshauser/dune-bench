[LOG] [37m    💭 Reasoning:[0m
[LOG] [2m       **Prediction Made: Atreides will win on Turn 1**

**Reasoning:**
- [0m
[LOG] [2m       Atreides controls Arrakeen (1 of 3 strongholds needed) at game start
- [0m
[LOG] [2m       They are the strongest faction with excellent leaders and card [0m
[LOG] [2m       abilities
- With only 1 turn maximum in this game, quick aggressive play [0m
[LOG] [2m       is essential
- If Atreides can secure 2 more strongholds in the initial [0m
[LOG] [2m       phases of turn 1, they win immediately
- If my prediction comes true, I [0m
[LOG] [2m       win instead of them - a perfect outcome for the Bene Gesserit!

Now the [0m
[LOG] [2m       game unfolds, and I'll use my Voice ability and Spiritual Advisors [0m
[LOG] [2m       strategically to either help Atreides reach their predicted victory, or [0m
