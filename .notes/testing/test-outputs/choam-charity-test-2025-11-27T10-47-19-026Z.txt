[LOG] [2m       **Prediction Made: Fremen will win on Turn 1**

**Reasoning:**
- The [0m

- Fremen [0m
[LOG] [2m       control Sietch Tabr and have strong desert positioning

[LOG] [2m       placement.

**Reasoning:**
- This is a moderate dial that will move the [0m

- It [0m
[LOG] [2m       positions the storm away from my stronghold at Carthag (sector 11)
- The [0m
