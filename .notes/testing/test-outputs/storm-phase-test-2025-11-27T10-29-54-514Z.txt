[LOG] [37m    💭 Reasoning:[0m
[LOG] [2m       **My Prediction: Fremen will win on Turn 1**

**Reasoning:**
- The Fremen [0m
[LOG] [2m       have their stronghold (Sietch Tabr) already under their control, giving [0m
[LOG] [2m       them a strategic advantage
- With the game apparently configured for very [0m
[LOG] [2m       short play (maxTurns: 1), the Fremen's defensive home position and [0m
[LOG] [2m       existing stronghold make them well-positioned to achieve victory
- If the [0m
[LOG] [2m       game mechanics allow for rapid victory conditions or if the turn [0m
[LOG] [2m       structure is compressed, the Fremen's existing territorial control could [0m
[LOG] [2m       lead to a quick win
- As the Bene Gesserit, if my prediction comes true, [0m
[LOG] [2m       I win instead - so I'm betting on the faction with the most immediate [0m
[LOG] [2m       advantage [0m

[LOG] [2m       **Decision Made:** I've selected **Staban Tuek** as my traitor.

This is [0m
[LOG] [2m       a strong strategic choice because:
- He's the highest-strength leader [0m
[LOG] [2m       available to me (strength 5)
- Spacing Guild is likely to be a [0m
[LOG] [2m       significant opponent
- If they deploy him in battle, I can call [0m
[LOG] [2m       "Traitor!" and automatically win that engagement

**Reasoning:** Otheym [0m
[LOG] [2m       is a strength-5 Fremen leader - high enough that he's likely to be [0m
[LOG] [2m       deployed in important battles. By holding his card, I can automatically [0m
