- worthless cards etc can be played in battle
- if someone is below the storm aka same sector faction token as the storm is placed, then they are in fact a dialer for the storm, and the next person in storm order too!
- when hark buys a card in bidding they receive a second one for free which atreides can't see, up to a hadn limit of 8 so if they have 7 when they buy one they dont get one for free
- you can auto skip factions in bidding that don't have enough spice, unless they have a karama card then they havea tool called: "trade karama card for treachery card" or smth, so tehy can buy a treachery card for free
- probably we need to have some sort of special tracking for atreides setup, for the card tracking during bidding phase. 
- harkonnen moved out of the storm stronghold in this game: game_mileklq9_1e51b561 shipment movement phase turn 1, investigate the logs
- storm turn 2 stuck always
- probably movement is not working yet, all of them are skipping all the time
- ⚠️ Battle plans showing 0 vs 0 forces - both sides had 0 forces dialed in turn 3 battle (game_mim8227z_1e338004). Might be AI/agent issue or default plan bug. Battle identification is working correctly now.
- cielago north spice location is in th wrong place adjust on figma, code is correct i guess  actually not!!! 
- same for old gap -> actually not!!! 
- no deals possible yet
- no alliance working yet i guess
- spice blow is not a deck it's just andm pick 
- spice placed is not correct.
- there are 3 spice blows with 6 players why?
