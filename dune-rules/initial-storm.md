# Initial Storm Phase

## Overview

The initial storm placement occurs during game setup (before Turn 1) and uses a different procedure than regular storm movement. This determines where the storm starts on the board and establishes the First Player for the first turn.

## Standard Procedure

### Who Participates

The **two players whose player markers are nearest on either side of the Storm Start Sector** participate in the initial storm placement.

### Process

1. Both players **secretly dial a number from 0 to 20** on their Battle Wheels
2. The numbers are **simultaneously revealed**
3. The two numbers are **totaled together**
4. The Storm Marker is moved from the **Storm Start Sector** counterclockwise around the map for the **sum total of Sectors**

### Example

- Player A dials 12
- Player B dials 8
- Total: 20 sectors
- Storm Marker moves 20 sectors counterclockwise from the Storm Start Sector

## Determining First Player

After the initial storm placement, the **First Player** for Turn 1 is determined by:

> The faction whose Player Marker the storm next approaches will be the First Player for this Turn in each applicable Phase and action.

This First Player status applies to:
- Storm Phase
- Bidding Phase
- Shipment and Movement Phase
- Battle Phase
- Mentat Pause Phase

## Fremen Exception

If the **Fremen** faction is in play, they have a special ability that modifies the initial storm procedure:

- The storm is moved **normally using the Battle Wheels** on the first Turn (same as standard procedure)
- The Fremen player then **randomly selects a card from the Storm Deck** and places it face down on the margin of the game board
- In the **next Storm Phase** (Turn 2), the number on that Storm Card is revealed
- The storm is moved counterclockwise that number of Sectors
- The Storm Card is returned to the Storm Card Deck
- The Fremen then shuffles the Storm Deck, randomly selects a Storm Card for the next turn's storm movement, and places it face down on the margin

This means the Fremen control storm movement starting from Turn 2, but the initial placement (Turn 1) still uses the standard two-player dialing procedure.

## Differences from Regular Storm Movement

| Aspect | Initial Storm (Turn 1) | Regular Storm (Turn 2+) |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Participants** | Two players nearest Storm Start Sector | Two players who last used Battle Wheels |
| **Dial Range** | 0 to 20 | 1 to 3 |
| **Starting Point** | Storm Start Sector | Current storm position |
| **Purpose** | Random initial placement | Regular storm advancement |
