# 1.06 Shipment And Movement Phase

This is the sixth Phase of the Turn. All players are allowed to Ship and/or Move Forces during this Phase, Placing their Forces onto the planet or moving Forces across the board.

The First Player conducts their Force Shipment action and then Force Movement action. Play proceeds in Storm Order until all players have completed this Phase or indicated they will not use their actions. -2.06.12.01 -3.03.05.02 -3.03.05.03

**Note:** Spacing Guild has special timing abilities that allow them to act out of storm order (see Spacing Guild abilities below).

## 1.06.01 ONE FORCE SHIPMENT
Each player may make only one Force Shipment action per Turn.

## 1.06.02 Shipment of Reserves
A player with off-planet reserves may use one shipment action to Ship any number of Forces from their reserves to any one Territory on the board. -1.14.05 +2.06.05 +2.06.09

On your Ship action you must adhere to the following:

### 1.06.02.01 COST
The cost of shipping off-planet reserves is 1 spice per Force shipped into any Stronghold and 2 spice per Force shipped into any Non-Stronghold Territory. -2.06.06 -2.06.09 -3.01.11.03

**Special:** Spacing Guild pays only half price (rounded up) for their own shipments. -2.06.06

### 1.06.02.02 PAYMENT
All spice paid for Shipment is Placed in the Spice Bank. -2.06.04

**Exception:** When Spacing Guild is in the game, other factions pay the Guild instead of the Spice Bank. -2.06.04

### 1.06.02.03 SECTORS
When shipping into a Territory lying in several Sectors, a player must make clear in which Sector of the Territory they choose to leave their Forces.

### 1.06.02.04 RESTRICTION
No player may Ship into or out of a Sector in Storm. -2.04.17

### 1.06.02.05 OCCUPANCY LIMIT
No player may Ship into a stronghold already occupied by two other player's Forces. -2.02.11

### 1.06.02.06 Restriction
No player may ship Forces from the board back to their reserves. -2.06.05.02

**Exception:** Spacing Guild can ship Forces from board back to reserves using their OFF-PLANET ability. -2.06.05.01

## 1.06.03 FORCE MOVEMENT
Each player may Move, as a group, any number of their Forces from one Territory into one other Territory. Unless separated by Storm, that player may Move groups of Forces from different Sectors of the same Territory.

On your Movement action you must adhere to the following:

### 1.06.03.01 ONE FORCE MOVE
Each player may make only one Force movement action per Turn. -3.01.09 -3.03.11.02

**Exception:** The Hajr Treachery Card allows an extra movement action. -3.01.10

Forces are free to Move into, out of, or through any Territory occupied by any number of Forces with certain restrictions and additional movement advantage mentioned below.

### 1.06.03.02 ONE ADJACENT TERRITORY
A player without a Force in either Arrakeen or Carthag at the start of their movement can only Move their Forces to one adjacent Territory. -2.04.06 -3.03.11.01

**Exception:** Fremen can Move two territories instead of one (see Fremen abilities below). -2.04.06

### 1.06.03.03 ORNITHOPTERS
A player who starts a force move with one or more Forces in either Arrakeen, Carthag, or both, has access to ornithopters and may Move Forces through up to three adjacent territories. The Forces moved do not have to be in Arrakeen or Carthag to make the three Territory Move.

Thus, for example, a player with one or more Forces in Arrakeen would be able to move Forces starting in Tuek's Sietch through Pasty Mesa and Shield Wall to the Imperial Basin, where they must stop.

**Note:** Ornithopters grant movement through up to 3 territories, but you must still end your movement in a valid territory (subject to storm and occupancy limits).

### 1.06.03.04 SECTORS
Sectors have no effect on movement. Forces can Move into or through a Territory ignoring all Sectors. A Sector's only function is to regulate the movement and coverage of the storm and spice collection.

### 1.06.03.05 STORM
As defined above in the Storm Phase section, no Force may Move into, out of, or through a Sector in storm.

Many territories occupy several Sectors, so that a player may Move into and out of a Territory that is partly in the storm, so long as the group does not pass through the part covered by the storm.

When ending a Move in a Territory lying in several Sectors, a player must make clear in which Sector of the Territory they choose to leave their Forces.

### 1.06.03.06 Occupancy Limit
Like Shipment, Forces can not be moved into or through a Stronghold if Forces of two other players are already there. -2.02.20

### 1.06.03.07 SAFE HAVEN
The Polar Sink is never in storm.

### 1.06.03.08 CONSTRAINT
At the end of your Shipment and Movement actions, Place all your Forces that are in the same Territory (except the Polar Sink) as your Ally's Forces in the Tleilaxu Tanks. -2.02.12

**Note:** This applies to all Forces in the same territory as an ally, regardless of sector. Advisors are exempt from this constraint.

### 1.06.03.09 Repositioning
A player may use their movement action to reposition their Forces to relocate to a different Sector within the same Territory. Storm limitations still apply.
