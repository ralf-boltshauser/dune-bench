# Storm Phase - Complete Rules Summary

## Overview

**Phase 1.01: Storm Phase**

This is the **first Phase of each Turn**. In this Phase, the Storm Marker is moved around the Map and Storm Order is determined for the Turn.

**Note:** This document covers the **normal Storm Phase** (Turn 2+). For the initial storm placement during setup, see `initial-storm.md`.

---

## Basic Phase Procedure

### 1.01.01 DECIDING FIRST PLAYER

**Rule:**
- The faction whose **Player Marker the storm next approaches** will be the **First Player** for this Turn
- First Player status applies to:
  - Storm Phase
  - Bidding Phase
  - Shipment and Movement Phase
  - Battle Phase
  - Mentat Pause Phase

**Determination:**
- After storm movement is complete, identify which player marker the storm next approaches counterclockwise
- That player becomes First Player for all applicable phases of the turn

### 1.01.02 STORM MOVEMENT

**Standard Procedure (Turn 2+):**
- The **two players who last used the Battle Wheels** will independently dial a number
- Each player dials a number from **1 to 3** on their Battle Wheel
- Both players **simultaneously Reveal** their numbers
- The two numbers are **added together**
- The Storm Marker is advanced from its **current position** counterclockwise around the Map the **sum total of Sectors**

**Fremen Exception (-2.04.13 -3.01.23):**
- If Fremen is in play, they use a different system (see Fremen Abilities below)

**Example:**
- Player A dials 2
- Player B dials 3
- Total: 5 sectors
- Storm moves 5 sectors counterclockwise from current position

### 1.01.03 STORM DESTRUCTION

**When the Storm Marker moves:**

**Forces Destroyed:**
- Any Forces in a **Sector of a Sand Territory** (except the Imperial Basin) over which the storm:
  - **Starts** (the sector where the storm begins)
  - **Passes** (any sectors the storm moves through)
  - **Ends** (the sector where the storm stops)
- These Forces are **destroyed** and **Placed in the Tleilaxu Tanks**

**Forces Protected:**
- Forces that are **not on a Sand Territory** find protection from the storm
- Forces on **Rock Territories** are protected
- Forces in the **Imperial Basin** are protected
- Forces in the **Polar Sink** are protected (it's never in storm)

**Spice Destroyed:**
- Any spice in a Sector which a storm **passes over or stops** is destroyed
- Destroyed spice is **Placed in the Spice Bank**

**Fremen Exception (-2.04.16):**
- Fremen Forces take only half losses (rounded up) - see Fremen Abilities below

**Treachery Card Exception (-3.01.07):**
- Some Treachery Cards may modify storm destruction (see Special Cards below)

### 1.01.04 OBSTRUCTION

**Movement Restrictions:**
- Forces may **not Ship/Send/Move into, out of, or through a Sector in Storm**
- This applies during the Shipment and Movement Phase

**Battle Restrictions:**
- Forces may **not battle** if:
  - Either Force is in storm and the other is not, OR
  - Forces are separated by a sector in storm
- Forces in the **same Territory but different sectors** (one in storm, one not) cannot battle

- You then **shuffle the Storm Deck**, randomly select a Storm Card for the next turn's storm movement, and Put it face down on the margin

**Effect:**
- Fremen **control storm movement** starting from Turn 2
- Instead of two players dialing, Fremen uses a Storm Deck

**Note:** This replaces the standard storm movement procedure (-3.01.23).

#### 2.04.16 ✷THERE'S A STORM COMING

**Ability:**

#### 2.04.18 STORM LOSSES ✷

**Ability:**

- A storm landing on your Forces then moving in a subsequent Turn does **not destroy half of your Forces a second time**
- This means if forces survive a storm, they are not destroyed again if the storm passes over them later

**Example:**
- Fremen has 7 forces in a storm sector
- Only 4 are destroyed (7 ÷ 2 = 3.5, rounded up = 4)
- 3 forces survive
- If storm passes over them again, they are not destroyed again

## Strategic Considerations

### When to Play Weather Control

- **Prevent movement:** Stop storm to maintain current positions
- **Affect spice placement:** Control where storm will be for Spice Blow Phase

### When to Play Family Atomics

- **Destroy Shield Wall forces:** Eliminate all forces on the wall
- **Remove city protection:** Make Imperial Basin, Arrakeen, and Carthag vulnerable
- **Strategic timing:** Play when it benefits you most
- **Consider consequences:** Once played, cities lose protection permanently

### Fremen Strategy

- **Control storm movement:** Use Storm Deck to your advantage
- **Know future movement:** Look at Storm Card to plan ahead
- **Half losses:** Take calculated risks with storm exposure
- **Storm Migration:** Use ability to ship into storm at reduced cost

### General Strategy

- **Position forces:** Keep important forces in protected territories
