## Nexus - Alliance Formation

### When Nexus Occurs

Once a **Shai-Hulud** (sandworm) card is turned over on the **second or subsequent turns**, at the **end of the Spice Blow and Nexus Phase**, a Nexus occurs. During a Nexus, all players have a chance to make, join or break Alliances. Once players have had a chance to do so, play continues.

### Nexus Procedure

#### Discussion
Players may **discuss among themselves** the advantages and disadvantages of allying, and with whom.

#### Forming an Alliance
- A player may **ally once per Nexus**
- **Two players** may announce that they are forming an Alliance
- They are now **allied**

#### Breaking an Alliance

- A player announces that they are breaking from their Alliance

#### Conclusion of a Nexus
- Once all players have had a chance to ally, **no further Alliances can be made** until the next Nexus

### How Alliances Function

#### Victory Conditions
- Allied players' Forces are considered the same for the purposes of victory
- The win condition is now **4 strongholds instead of 3** for players in an Alliance
- If together their joint Forces Control 4 or more strongholds in the Mentat Pause Phase, they have jointly won the game

#### Ally Secrecy
- Allies may **discuss and share strategy and information secretly** at any time

#### Separate Spice Holding
- Allies **may not give spice to one another** (Exception: Emperor can give spice to ally - see Emperor abilities)

#### Bidding Assistance
