## Strategic Considerations

### When to Claim Charity

- **Always claim if eligible** (0-1 spice) unless you have a specific strategic reason not to
- Charity provides free spice without cost
- Having at least 2 spice is important for bidding, revival, and shipments

### Bene Gesserit Strategy (Advanced Game)

- Can claim charity even with high spice holdings
- Useful for maintaining spice reserves
- Can be cancelled by Karama, so timing may matter

### Homeworld Strategy

- Factions at Low Threshold get extra benefit from charity
- May influence decisions about when to use reserves (affecting threshold status)
- Extra spice can be significant for factions struggling with reserves

### Card Play Timing

- **Truthtrance** can be used to verify spice holdings before charity claims
- **Karama** can be used to cancel Bene Gesserit ability
- **Tleilaxu Ghola** can be played but doesn't affect charity directly
