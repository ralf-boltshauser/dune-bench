Alliances
Once a Shai-Hulud (sandworm) card is turned over on the second or subsequent turns, at the end of the Spice Blow and Nexus Phase, a Nexus occurs. During a Nexus, all players have a chance to make, join or break Alliances. Once players have had a chance to do so, play continues.
NEXUS
Discussion: Players may discuss among themselves the advantages and disadvantages of allying, and with whom.
Forming an Alliance: A player may ally once per Nexus. Two players may announce that they are forming an Alliance, they are now allied.
Transparency: The members of an Alliance must be made known to all. Alliances cannot be secret. Swap Alliance Cards as a reminder of who is in an Alliance.
Alliance Limits: No more than two players may be in an Alliance with each other.
Landsraad Limits: Several Alliances can be formed during a Nexus, but no player can be a member of more than one Alliance.
Breaking an Alliance: Any player may break an Alliance during a Nexus. A player announces that they are breaking from their Alliance, they are now unallied.
Conclusion of A Nexus: Once all players have had a chance to ally, no further Alliances can be made until the next Nexus.
