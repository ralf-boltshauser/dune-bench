Battle Phase
This is the seventh Phase of the Turn. Players must resolve battles in every Territory that is occupied by Forces from two or more factions.
Battle Determination: Wherever two or more players' Forces occupy the same Territory, battles must occur between those players. Battles continue until just one player's Forces, or no Forces remain in all territories on the Board. -1.07.01.00 -1.07.01.02 -2.02.12
Players can not battle one another in a Territory if their Forces are separated by a Sector in storm. Their Forces can remain in the same Territory at the end of the Phase.
BATTLING BLIND: Whenever two or more players’ Forces are in the same Territory and in the same Sector under storm players still battle.
NEUTRAL ZONE: Players can not battle in the Polar Sink. It is a safe haven for everyone.
FIRST PLAYER: When resolving battles, the First Player is named the Aggressor until all their battles, if any, have been fought. The Aggressor chooses the order in which they wish to fight their battles. Then the player next in Storm Order becomes the Aggressor and so on, until all battles are resolved. -3.03.05.01
MULTIPLE BATTLES: When there are three or more players in the same Territory, the Aggressor picks who they will battle first, second, etc. for as long as they have Forces in that Territory.
Battle Plan: To resolve a battle, each player secretly formulates a Battle Plan. -1.14.01 -2.01.08 -2.01.09
A Battle Plan always includes the number of Forces dialed on the Battle Wheel. When possible, it must include a player's leader or a Cheap Hero. It may include Treachery Cards at the player's discretion.
BATTLE WHEEL: Each player picks up a Battle Wheel and secretly dials a number from zero to the number of Forces they have in the disputed Territory. Both players will lose the number of Forces dialed on their Battle Wheel.
LEADERS: One Leader Disc is selected and put face up in the slot on the wheel. A Cheap Hero Card may be played in lieu of a Leader Disc.
DEDICATED LEADER: Leaders that survive battles may fight more than once in a single Territory if needed, but no leader may fight in more than one Territory during the same Phase. -1.07.06.06.00
LEADER ANNOUNCEMENT: A player must always play either a leader or a Cheap Hero card as part of their Battle Plan if possible. When it is not possible, a player must announce that they can not play a leader or Cheap Hero.
NO TREACHERY: A player with no leader or Cheap Hero must still battle, but they can not play any Treachery Cards as part of their Battle Plan. (This situation can occur when a player does not have a Cheap Hero and all their leaders are in the Tleilaxu Tanks or have fought in another Territory in that Phase.)
TREACHERY CARDS: Players with a leader or Cheap Hero may play a Weapon Treachery Card, Defense Treachery Card, or both by holding them against the wheel. They may choose not to play Treachery Cards as well. +2.02.06 +2.02.07
REVEALING WHEELS: When both players are ready, the Battle Plans are Revealed simultaneously.
BATTLE RESOLUTION: The winner is the player with the higher total of number dialed on the Battle Wheel, plus their leader's fighting strength if applicable. -1.14.11
NO TIES: In the case of a tie, the Aggressor wins the battle.
WEAPONS: Check to see if your opponent protected their leader from your weapon with the proper Defense, if they did not, do not add their leader's fighting strength to their number dialed. Next, see if your weapon affects your leader, if it does check to see if you played the proper Defense, if not do not add your leader's fighting strength to your number dialed.
Note: Some weapons may not kill leaders but still make the leader's fighting strength nonapplicable.
KILLED LEADERS: Any leaders killed are immediately Placed face up in the Tleilaxu TanksThe winner immediately receives their value (including their own leader, if killed) in spice from the Spice Bank. -1.05.04 -3.02.02
SURVIVING LEADERS: Leaders who survive remain in the Territory where they were used. (Game effects do not kill these leaders while there.) These are not part of the Leader Pool until Leader Return [1.07.07]. -2.05.10 -4.03.08
LOSING: The losing player loses all the Forces they had in the Territory to the Tleilaxu Tanks and must discard every Treachery Card they used in their Battle Plan. Note that the loser does not lose their leader as a result of losing the battle.
WINNING: The winning player loses only the number of Forces they dialed on the Battle Wheel. These Forces are Placed in the Tleilaxu Tanks. The winning player may discard any of the cards they played; that player may keep any cards that do not say "Discard after use". -1.14.12
TRAITORS: When you are in a battle and your opponent uses a leader that matches a Traitor Card in your hand, you may call out "Traitor!" and pause the game. This can be done against any Active Leader your opponent has, even when that leader was not one of their Active Leaders at the start of the game.-2.01.12 +2.05.09 +4.09.01
When a Traitor Card is Revealed the Player who revealed the Traitor Card: immediately wins the battle, loses nothing, regardless of what was played in the Battle Plans (even if a lasgun and shield are Revealed), adds their leader back to their leader pool to be available again this Phase, Places the traitorous leader in the Tleilaxu Tanks, and receives the traitorous leader's fighting strength in spice from the Spice Bank. One time use abilities may be considered not used for this instance (Ex: Kwisatz Haderach, Captured leaders). One time use cards may be kept or discarded by the winner.
The Player Whose Traitor Was Revealed: loses all their Forces in the Territory and discards all of the cards they played.
TWO TRAITORS: When both leaders are traitors (each a traitor for the opponent), both players' Forces in the Territory, their cards played, and their leaders, are lost. Neither player receives any spice.
LEADER RETURN: After all battles have been fought, players collect any of their leaders used in battle still in Territories adding them to their Leader Pool.

Advanced Game
For experienced players the game is changed by adding these rules: increasing the number of Spice Blows, adding a spice advantage for holding a city or Tuek's Sietch, (the smuggler stronghold), an enhanced Karama Card, an advanced battle system, and additional faction abilities (as stated in 2.xx.00). Decide as a group if you are playing Advanced in Set Up before any other step (0.00).
Increased Spice Flow: During Collection Phase [1.08], each occupant of Carthag and Arrakeen collects 2 spice and the occupant of Tuek's Sietch collects 1 spice. To qualify for collection, a player needs to occupy the stronghold only at the time of collection. If a player occupies two or three of these strongholds, they collect spice for each that they occupy.
DOUBLE SPICE BLOW: After 1.02.01 another Spice Card will be Revealed creating a second Spice Card discard pile (discard pile A and discard pile B).
When using double spice blow:
When a Shai-Hulud appears in the first discard pile (Pile A) any spice and Forces on a Territory Card at the top of discard pile A (if any) are lost to the Spice Bank and Tleilaxu Tanks respectively. The Shai-Hulud card is Put on the spice discard pile. Then another card is turned over. If it is a Shai-Hulud it is immediately discarded on pile A and another card is turned over. This continues until a Territory Card appears and spice is placed as defined in 1.02.04. The Territory Card is put face up on spice discard pile A. Then a Nexus occurs.
Now Reveal another spice card and repeat the above procedure using discard pile B.
SPICE DECK RESUFFLE: When the Spice Deck needs to be reshuffled, Shuffle in all discarded territory and Shai-Hulud cards under the top most territory card in Spice Discard Pile A and all Territory and Shai-Hulud cards in Spice Discard Pile B into the deck.
SPICE DIALING: Each Force used in a battle is valued at its full strength if 1 spice is paid to support it. -2.04.21
Spice now plays an important role in the combat procedure. When using spice dialing:
UNSPICED FORCES: A Force used in a battle that is not supported by 1 spice is valued at half strength.
NUMBER DIALED CALCULATION: When dialing a Battle Plan, one-half increments can be indicated by lining up the line between the numbers with the line under the window of the Battle Wheel.
SPICED FORCES: When creating a Battle Plan, a player must add the amount of spice they plan to pay in the battle to their Battle Wheel.
PAYMENT: All spice paid for Spice Dialing is Placed in the Spice Bank.
LOSING NOTHING: When a traitor card is played, the winner keeps all spice paid to support their Forces.
ONE TIME ULTIMATE: When playing a Karama Card [3.01.11], in addition to it's normal effects a player may now use it to implement their Faction's special Karama power once per game.

3 Treachery Cards
This Category goes over the Treachery Cards a player can play and how these rules interact and supersede the rules of the game and Faction abilities.
A faction has special abilities that may contradict the rules. A faction's particular abilities always have precedence over the rules.
A Treachery Card may contradict the rules or a faction's particular abilities. A Treachery Card always has precedence over the rules and faction abilities.
A Variant [4] may contradict the rules, a faction ability, or a Treachery Card. Variants always have precedence over the rules, faction abilities, and Treachery Cards.
When a Karama card is used to cancel an ability, as detailed in Karama card description 3.01.11.01 and 3.01.11.02, the faction whose ability is cancelled may recalculate and retake that same action (ex: revival, shipment, movement) without the ability.
When a faction’s ability is used all other actions that can take place must wait until the ability is complete. After the ability is completely done players may use abilities, play cards, and make Bribes. -3.01.11
