Mentat Pause Phase
This is the ninth Phase of the Turn. A winner (or winners) is declared, or players take some time to evaluate their positions on the map, then move the Turn Counter to the next position on the Turn Track to begin the next Turn.
COLLECT BRIBE SPICE: Add any spice from in front of your shield to your spice reserves.
Stronghold Victory
Players now check to see if the following requirements are met to achieve Stronghold Victory for one or more players.
Unallied Stronghold Victory: The requirement for an Unallied player to win is to Control three or more Strongholds with at least one of their Forces during the Mentat Pause Phase.
Allied Stronghold Victory: The requirement for an Alliance to win is to Control, between the Allied players, a total of four or more Strongholds with at least one or more Forces during the Mentat Pause Phase.
For example: if the Atreides are in an Alliance with the Fremen, and the Fremen Control Sietch Tabr, Carthag, and the Atreides Control Tuek's Sietch and Arrakeen during the Mentat Pause Phase, they win the game together.

MULTIPLE WINNERS: A player or alliance that has met the Stronghold requirement wins the game. When multiple player(s) and/or alliance(s) meet the requirements (as defined in 1.09.02) for a stronghold victory only the player or alliance first in Storm Order wins the game. -2.02.03
WAR CONTINUES: When there are no winners, players mull over their positions on the board, consider their options and, when they are ready, move the turn marker to the next position on the Turn Track to begin the next Turn.
END GAME OR DEFAULT VICTORY: The game is over when the desired number of Turns are reached. On the last Turn if no one has won and the Spacing Guild is not in the game the Fremen win. When the Fremen are not in the game either, the player Occupying the most Strongholds wins. If several qualify, all who qualify win. +2.06.08 +2.06.11
Alliances
Once a Shai-Hulud (sandworm) card is turned over on the second or subsequent turns, at the end of the Spice Blow and Nexus Phase, a Nexus occurs. During a Nexus, all players have a chance to make, join or break Alliances. Once players have had a chance to do so, play continues.
NEXUS
Discussion: Players may discuss among themselves the advantages and disadvantages of allying, and with whom.
Forming an Alliance: A player may ally once per Nexus. Two players may announce that they are forming an Alliance, they are now allied.
Transparency: The members of an Alliance must be made known to all. Alliances cannot be secret. Swap Alliance Cards as a reminder of who is in an Alliance.
Alliance Limits: No more than two players may be in an Alliance with each other.
Landsraad Limits: Several Alliances can be formed during a Nexus, but no player can be a member of more than one Alliance.
Breaking an Alliance: Any player may break an Alliance during a Nexus. A player announces that they are breaking from their Alliance, they are now unallied.
Conclusion of A Nexus: Once all players have had a chance to ally, no further Alliances can be made until the next Nexus.
How an Alliance Functions
Allied players' Forces are considered the same for the purposes of victory.
The win condition is now 4 strongholds instead of 3 for players in an Alliance. If together their joint Forces Control 4 or more strongholds in the Mentat Pause Phase, they have jointly won the game. -2.11.15
Ally Secrecy: Allies may discuss and share strategy and information secretly at any time.
Separate Spice Holding: Allies may not give spice to one another. -2.03.06
Bidding: During the Bidding Phase, allies may help each other by paying some or all the cost of each other's Treachery Cards so that a player can bid more spice than they actually have.
Movement: During the Shipment and Movement Phase, allies may pay for each other's shipments.
Constraint: At the end of your Shipment and Movement actions, Place all your Forces that are in the same Territory (except the Polar Sink) as your Ally's Forces in the Tleilaxu Tanks. -2.02.12
