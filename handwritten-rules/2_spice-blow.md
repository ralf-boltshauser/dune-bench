Spice Blow And Nexus Phase
This is the second Phase of the Turn. In this Phase spice is Placed on the board and alliances can be made.
BLOW THE SPICE: The top card of the Spice Deck is Revealed and discarded. +1.14.03
FIRST TURN: During the first turn's Spice Blow Phase only, all Shai-Hulud cards Revealed are ignored, Set Aside, then reshuffled back into the Spice deck after this Phase.
NO NEXUS: There can not be a Nexus on Turn one for any reason.
TERRITORY CARD: This is a Spice Blow. When this type of card is discarded the amount of spice indicated on the card is taken from the Spice Bank and Placed onto the Territory in the Sector containing the Spice Blow icon. (If the Spice Blow icon is currently in storm, no spice is Placed for that Spice Blow.)
SHAI-HULUD: This is a Sandworm. When this type of card is discarded destroy all spice and Forces in the Territory of the topmost Territory Card in the discard pile and Place them in the Spice Bank and Tleilaxu Tanks respectively. Continue discarding Spice Blow cards until a Territory Card is discarded. Now a Nexus will occur. -2.04.07
NEXUS: Revealing a Shai-Hulud card after the first Turn causes a Nexus at the end of the Phase. In a Nexus, Alliances can be formed and broken (See Alliances 1.10)

Alliances
Once a Shai-Hulud (sandworm) card is turned over on the second or subsequent turns, at the end of the Spice Blow and Nexus Phase, a Nexus occurs. During a Nexus, all players have a chance to make, join or break Alliances. Once players have had a chance to do so, play continues.
NEXUS
Discussion: Players may discuss among themselves the advantages and disadvantages of allying, and with whom.
Forming an Alliance: A player may ally once per Nexus. Two players may announce that they are forming an Alliance, they are now allied.
Transparency: The members of an Alliance must be made known to all. Alliances cannot be secret. Swap Alliance Cards as a reminder of who is in an Alliance.
Alliance Limits: No more than two players may be in an Alliance with each other.
Landsraad Limits: Several Alliances can be formed during a Nexus, but no player can be a member of more than one Alliance.
Breaking an Alliance: Any player may break an Alliance during a Nexus. A player announces that they are breaking from their Alliance, they are now unallied.
Conclusion of A Nexus: Once all players have had a chance to ally, no further Alliances can be made until the next Nexus.
How an Alliance Functions
Allied players' Forces are considered the same for the purposes of victory.
The win condition is now 4 strongholds instead of 3 for players in an Alliance. If together their joint Forces Control 4 or more strongholds in the Mentat Pause Phase, they have jointly won the game. -2.11.15
Ally Secrecy: Allies may discuss and share strategy and information secretly at any time.
Separate Spice Holding: Allies may not give spice to one another. -2.03.06
Bidding: During the Bidding Phase, allies may help each other by paying some or all the cost of each other's Treachery Cards so that a player can bid more spice than they actually have.
Movement: During the Shipment and Movement Phase, allies may pay for each other's shipments.
Constraint: At the end of your Shipment and Movement actions, Place all your Forces that are in the same Territory (except the Polar Sink) as your Ally's Forces in the Tleilaxu Tanks. -2.02.12
Shared Advantages: Allies may assist one another with any abilities labeled: ALLIANCE.
