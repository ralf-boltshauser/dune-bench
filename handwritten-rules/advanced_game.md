Advanced Game
For experienced players the game is changed by adding these rules: increasing the number of Spice Blows, adding a spice advantage for holding a city or Tuek's Sietch, (the smuggler stronghold), an enhanced Karama Card, an advanced battle system, and additional faction abilities (as stated in 2.xx.00). Decide as a group if you are playing Advanced in Set Up before any other step (0.00).
Increased Spice Flow: During Collection Phase [1.08], each occupant of Carthag and Arrakeen collects 2 spice and the occupant of Tuek's Sietch collects 1 spice. To qualify for collection, a player needs to occupy the stronghold only at the time of collection. If a player occupies two or three of these strongholds, they collect spice for each that they occupy.
DOUBLE SPICE BLOW: After 1.02.01 another Spice Card will be Revealed creating a second Spice Card discard pile (discard pile A and discard pile B).
When using double spice blow:
When a Shai-Hulud appears in the first discard pile (Pile A) any spice and Forces on a Territory Card at the top of discard pile A (if any) are lost to the Spice Bank and Tleilaxu Tanks respectively. The Shai-Hulud card is Put on the spice discard pile. Then another card is turned over. If it is a Shai-Hulud it is immediately discarded on pile A and another card is turned over. This continues until a Territory Card appears and spice is placed as defined in 1.02.04. The Territory Card is put face up on spice discard pile A. Then a Nexus occurs.
Now Reveal another spice card and repeat the above procedure using discard pile B.
SPICE DECK RESUFFLE: When the Spice Deck needs to be reshuffled, Shuffle in all discarded territory and Shai-Hulud cards under the top most territory card in Spice Discard Pile A and all Territory and Shai-Hulud cards in Spice Discard Pile B into the deck.
SPICE DIALING: Each Force used in a battle is valued at its full strength if 1 spice is paid to support it. -2.04.21
Spice now plays an important role in the combat procedure. When using spice dialing:
UNSPICED FORCES: A Force used in a battle that is not supported by 1 spice is valued at half strength.
NUMBER DIALED CALCULATION: When dialing a Battle Plan, one-half increments can be indicated by lining up the line between the numbers with the line under the window of the Battle Wheel.
SPICED FORCES: When creating a Battle Plan, a player must add the amount of spice they plan to pay in the battle to their Battle Wheel.
PAYMENT: All spice paid for Spice Dialing is Placed in the Spice Bank.
LOSING NOTHING: When a traitor card is played, the winner keeps all spice paid to support their Forces.
ONE TIME ULTIMATE: When playing a Karama Card [3.01.11], in addition to it's normal effects a player may now use it to implement their Faction's special Karama power once per game.
