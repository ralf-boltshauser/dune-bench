1 Phases of the Game
This Category of the rulebook goes over the Phases of the game and how the base rules are observed.
A faction has special abilities that may contradict the rules. A faction's particular abilities always have precedence over the rules.
A Treachery Card may contradict the rules or a faction's particular abilities. A Treachery Card always has precedence over the rules and faction abilities.
A Variant [4] may contradict the rules, a faction ability, or a Treachery Card. Variants always have precedence over the rules, faction abilities, and Treachery Cards.
When a Karama card is used to cancel an ability, as detailed in Karama card description 3.01.11.01 and 3.01.11.02, the faction whose ability is cancelled may recalculate and retake that same action (ex: revival, shipment, movement) without the ability.
When a faction’s ability is used all other actions that can take place must wait until the ability is complete. After the ability is completely done players may use abilities, play cards, and make Bribes. -3.01.11
Storm Phase
This is the first Phase of the Turn. In this Phase the Storm Marker is moved around the Map and Storm Order is determined for the Turn.
DECIDING FIRST PLAYER: The faction whose Player Marker the storm next approaches will be the First Player for this Turn in each applicable Phase and action.
STORM MOVEMENT: In all subsequent Storm Phases after Turn 1, the two players who last used the Battle Wheels will independently dial a number from 1 to 3, simultaneously Reveal their numbers, add them together, and then advance the Storm Marker from its current position counterclockwise around the Map the sum total of Sectors. -2.04.13 -3.01.23
STORM DESTRUCTION: When the Storm Marker moves, any Forces in a Sector of a Sand Territory (except the Imperial Basin) over which the storm starts, passes, or ends on are destroyed. Place these Forces in the Tleilaxu Tanks. Forces that are not on a Sand Territory find protection from the storm. In addition any spice in a Sector which a storm passes over or stops is destroyed and Placed in the Spice Bank. -2.04.16 -3.01.07
OBSTRUCTION: Forces may not Ship/Send/Move into, out of, or through a Sector in Storm. Forces may not battle if either Force is in storm and the other is not or, separated by a sector in storm. -2.04.17
