BIDDING: The bidding is started by the First Player. If that player is not eligible to bid the next player to the right who is eligible opens the bidding.
This is the procedure for bidding on a card:
The player who bids first must bid 1 spice or more otherwise they must pass. Bidding then proceeds to the bidder's immediate right. The next bidder may raise the bid or pass, this continues around the table until a top bid is made and all other players have passed.
Buying A Card: The top bidding player then pays the number of spice they bid to the Spice Bank and receives the card currently up for bid, adding it to their hand. -2.03.04 +2.05.08

NEXT STARTING BIDDER: In subsequent bidding during this Phase, the first eligible player, to the right of the player who opened the bid for the previous card, begins the bidding for the next card.
END OF BIDDING: Bidding for Treachery Cards continues until all cards available for bid have been auctioned off.
BOUGHT-IN: When a face down Treachery card is passed on by everyone, all remaining cards are returned to the top of the Treachery Deck in the order they were dealt out and bidding on face down Treachery Cards is over.
TRANSPARENCY: The amount (not the type) of Treachery Cards a player has in their hand must be made known upon request by another player during the Bidding Phase.
